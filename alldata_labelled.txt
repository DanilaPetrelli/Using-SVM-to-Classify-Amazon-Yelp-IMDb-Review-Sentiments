A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.	NEG
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.	NEG
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.	NEG
Very little music or anything to speak of.	NEG
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.	POS
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.	NEG
Wasted two hours.	NEG
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.	POS
A bit predictable.	NEG
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.	POS
And those baby owls were adorable.	POS
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.	POS
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.	POS
It Was So Cool.	POS
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.	POS
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.	NEG
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.	POS
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.	POS
It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.	POS
" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.	POS
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.	POS
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.	POS
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?	POS
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.	POS
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.	POS
This short film certainly pulls no punches.	NEG
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.	NEG
This is the number one best TH game in the series.	POS
It deserves strong love.	POS
It is an insane game.	POS
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.	POS
Waste your money on this game.	POS
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.	POS
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.	POS
Today the graphics are crap.	NEG
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.	POS
This game rocks.	POS
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.	POS
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.	POS
This was a flick doomed from its conception.	NEG
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.	NEG
I wasn't the least bit interested.	NEG
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.	NEG
But it's just not funny.	NEG
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.	NEG
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.	NEG
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.	NEG
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.	NEG
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.	NEG
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.	POS
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.	POS
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.	POS
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.	POS
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.	NEG
Long, whiny and pointless.	NEG
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.	NEG
Excellent cast, story line, performances.	POS
Totally believable.	POS
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.	POS
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.	POS
I sat riveted to the TV screen.	POS
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.	POS
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.	POS
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.	POS
I was very disappointed in the movie.	NEG
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.	NEG
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.	NEG
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.	NEG
This movie totally grates on my nerves.	NEG
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.	NEG
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.	NEG
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.	NEG
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.	NEG
There are some generally great things in it.	POS
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.	NEG
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.	POS
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.	POS
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.	POS
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.	POS
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.	POS
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.	NEG
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.	POS
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.	POS
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.	POS
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.	POS
Give this one a look.	POS
I gave it a 10	POS
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.	POS
It is a true classic.	POS
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.	POS
Definitely worth checking out.	POS
The problem was the script.	NEG
It was horrendous.	NEG
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.	NEG
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.	NEG
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.	POS
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.	POS
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.	POS
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.	POS
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.	POS
I don't think you will be disappointed.	POS
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.	NEG
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.	NEG
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.	NEG
Too politically correct.	NEG
Very disappointing.	NEG
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.	POS
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.	NEG
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.	NEG
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.	POS
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.	POS
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.	NEG
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!	NEG
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.	NEG
The directing seems too pretentious.	NEG
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.	NEG
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.	NEG
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.	NEG
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.	POS
I really liked that.	POS
A great film by a great director.	POS
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.	POS
The music in the film is really nice too.	POS
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.	POS
Brilliant!	POS
10/10	POS
I liked this movie way too much.	POS
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.	NEG
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.	POS
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.	NEG
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.	NEG
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.	NEG
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".	NEG
All in all, a great disappointment.	NEG
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".	NEG
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.	NEG
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.	NEG
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.	NEG
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.	NEG
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.	NEG
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.	NEG
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.	NEG
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.	NEG
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.	NEG
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.	POS
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.	NEG
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.	NEG
A truly, truly bad film.	NEG
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.	NEG
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.	NEG
I paid too much.	NEG
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.	POS
It was so BORING!	NEG
No plot whatsoever!	NEG
Again, no plot at all.	NEG
Horrible!	NEG
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!	NEG
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!	NEG
I hate movies like that.	NEG
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.	NEG
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!	NEG
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.	NEG
Awful.	NEG
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.	NEG
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.	NEG
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).	NEG
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.	NEG
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.	NEG
Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.	POS
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.	NEG
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.	NEG
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.	NEG
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.	NEG
I mean this in a terrible way.	NEG
This film has no redeeming features.	NEG
Everything is appalling.	NEG
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.	NEG
The story is beyond stupid.	NEG
The script iswas there a script?	NEG
The kids are annoying.	NEG
The lead man is charisma-free.	NEG
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.	NEG
I'll even say it again  this is torture.	NEG
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.	NEG
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.	NEG
Highly unrecommended.	NEG
If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.	NEG
Yes, it's that bad.	NEG
Nothing at all to recommend.	NEG
An excellent performance from Ms.	POS
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.	POS
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.	POS
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.	NEG
There were too many close ups.	NEG
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.	NEG
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.	NEG
"You'll love it!	POS
This movie is BAD.	NEG
So bad.	NEG
The film is way too long.	NEG
This is definitely one of the bad ones.	NEG
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.	POS
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.	POS
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.	POS
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.	POS
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.	NEG
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.	NEG
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.	NEG
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.	NEG
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.	POS
His performance is simply genius.	POS
He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire.	POS
" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.	POS
Ray Charles is legendary.	POS
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.	POS
Hitchcock is a great director.	POS
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.	NEG
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.	POS
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.	NEG
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.	NEG
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.	NEG
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.	NEG
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.	NEG
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.	NEG
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.	NEG
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.	NEG
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.	NEG
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.	NEG
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.	POS
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.	POS
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.	NEG
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.	NEG
The character developments also lacked in depth.	NEG
Woa, talk about awful.	NEG
Do not waste your time.	NEG
It was just too horrible.	NEG
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.	NEG
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.	NEG
The poor actors.	NEG
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.	NEG
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.	NEG
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.	NEG
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.	POS
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.	POS
Regrettably, the film fails.	NEG
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.	NEG
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.	NEG
Yet, I enjoy watching it.	POS
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.	NEG
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!	NEG
The dialogue sucked.	NEG
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.	NEG
The soundtrack sucked.	NEG
The acting sucked.	NEG
The concert sequences just sucked.	NEG
That was nice.	POS
That was funny.	POS
It was so funny.	POS
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.	NEG
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.	NEG
I came out of it feeling angry.	NEG
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.	POS
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.	POS
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).	POS
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.	POS
All things considered, a job very well done.	POS
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.	POS
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.	POS
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.	POS
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.	POS
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.	POS
Up there with the best of Melville.	POS
Everything about this film is simply incredible.	POS
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.	POS
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.	POS
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.	POS
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.	POS
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.	NEG
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.	NEG
There is a lot of beautiful places.	POS
It was forced, like everything in this movie.	NEG
Again, lame.	NEG
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.	NEG
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.	NEG
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.	NEG
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.	NEG
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.	NEG
The acting was bad.	NEG
Really bad.	NEG
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.	NEG
Camerawork - again, bad.	NEG
Rating: 1 out of 10.	NEG
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!	POS
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.	POS
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.	POS
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.	POS
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.	POS
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.	POS
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.	POS
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!	POS
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!	POS
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.	POS
I literally vomited while watching this film.	NEG
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.	POS
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.	POS
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.	POS
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.	POS
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.	POS
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.	NEG
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".	NEG
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .	NEG
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.	NEG
This is such a fun and funny movie.	POS
Highly entertaining at all angles.	POS
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.	POS
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.	POS
It even has its sweet moments.	POS
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.	POS
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.	POS
And I really did find them funny.	POS
This is actually a very smart movie.	POS
There is a brilliant twist ending.	POS
" I love it.	POS
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.	POS
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.	POS
I will never forget it now.	POS
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.	POS
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.	NEG
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.	NEG
This movie is terrible.	NEG
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.	NEG
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!	NEG
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!	NEG
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.	NEG
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.	NEG
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.	NEG
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.	NEG
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.	NEG
Glad I didn't pay to see it.	NEG
Didn't laugh or even smile once.	NEG
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...	NEG
It is a really good show to watch.	POS
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.	POS
Barney is definitely super DE duper.	POS
is pretty funny.	POS
Babie Bop is very cute.	POS
The kids are very cool too.	POS
" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.	NEG
It's just lame.	NEG
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.	NEG
Everything about this movie is stupid.	NEG
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.	NEG
It is shameful.	NEG
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.	POS
The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.	POS
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.	POS
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!	POS
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.	POS
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.	POS
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.	POS
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.	POS
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.	POS
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.	POS
Definitely worth checking out.	POS
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.	POS
This movie has a cutting edge to it.	POS
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.	POS
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.	NEG
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.	NEG
It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.	NEG
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.	NEG
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.	NEG
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.	NEG
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.	NEG
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.	NEG
Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.	POS
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.	POS
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)	POS
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!	NEG
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.	NEG
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.	NEG
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!	NEG
I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works.	POS
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.	POS
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.	POS
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.	POS
After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.	POS
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.	POS
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.	POS
) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.	POS
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".	POS
This is high adventure at its best.	POS
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.	POS
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.	POS
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.	POS
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.	NEG
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.	NEG
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.	NEG
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.	POS
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.	POS
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.	POS
For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!	POS
It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.	POS
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!	POS
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.	POS
I rather enjoyed it.	POS
I liked it.	POS
I couldn't take them seriously.	NEG
It really created a unique feeling though.	POS
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.	POS
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.	POS
Her role was played well.	POS
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.	POS
The camera really likes her in this movie.	POS
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.	POS
As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.	POS
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.	NEG
Even worse than Ticker!	NEG
& That movie was bad.	NEG
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!	NEG
It just blew.	NEG
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.	POS
I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!	POS
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.	NEG
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.	NEG
Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.	NEG
I wish I could enter negative values, admins?	NEG
The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.	NEG
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.	NEG
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.	NEG
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.	NEG
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.	NEG
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.	NEG
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.	NEG
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.	NEG
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).	POS
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.	POS
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.	NEG
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.	POS
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.	NEG
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.	POS
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.	NEG
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.	NEG
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.	POS
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.	NEG
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.	NEG
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.	POS
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.	POS
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.	POS
I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.	POS
Wow, what a bad film.	NEG
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.	NEG
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.	NEG
Not even good for camp value!	NEG
I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?	NEG
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.	NEG
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.	NEG
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!	NEG
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.	NEG
This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.	NEG
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.	NEG
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.	NEG
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.	NEG
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.	NEG
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.	NEG
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.	NEG
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.	NEG
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.	POS
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.	POS
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.	NEG
Even the squibs look awful.	NEG
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.	NEG
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.	NEG
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.	NEG
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.	NEG
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.	NEG
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.	NEG
The directing is sloppy at best.	NEG
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.	NEG
Of course, the acting is blah.	NEG
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.	NEG
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.	NEG
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.	POS
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.	POS
This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.	POS
This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.	POS
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.	POS
Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.	POS
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.	NEG
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.	NEG
Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.	POS
This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.	POS
But this movie really got to me.	POS
See it.	POS
I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.	POS
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.	POS
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.	POS
I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.	POS
Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.	POS
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.	POS
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.	POS
I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.	POS
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.	POS
The rest of the cast also play well.	POS
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.	POS
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.	NEG
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.	NEG
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.	NEG
What this film lacks is a convincing script.	NEG
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.	NEG
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.	NEG
The cast is good.	POS
For that, it's worth checking out.	POS
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.	NEG
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.	NEG
Everything about it is just bad.	NEG
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.	NEG
The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.	NEG
The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.	NEG
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!	NEG
It is zillion times away from reality.	NEG
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.	NEG
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.	NEG
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.	NEG
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.	NEG
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!	NEG
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.	NEG
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.	NEG
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!	NEG
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.	NEG
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.	NEG
the cast was great.	POS
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.	POS
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.	POS
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.	NEG
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.	NEG
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.	NEG
putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.	NEG
there is no real plot.	NEG
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.	NEG
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.	POS
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.	POS
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.	POS
However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.	POS
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.	POS
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.	POS
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.	NEG
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.	NEG
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.	POS
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.	POS
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.	NEG
This may be the only bad film he ever made.	NEG
So bad...well...it's just bad.	NEG
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.	NEG
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.	NEG
I thought it was bad.	NEG
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.	NEG
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.	NEG
The script is a big flawed mess.	NEG
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.	NEG
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.	NEG
The movie is terribly boring in places.	NEG
The lighting is awful.	NEG
The film looks cheap and bland.	NEG
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.	NEG
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.	NEG
The visual effects were AWFUL.	NEG
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!	NEG
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.	NEG
Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.	POS
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!	POS
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.	NEG
Not recommended.	NEG
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.	NEG
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.	NEG
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.	NEG
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.	NEG
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).	POS
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.	NEG
The budget was evidently very limited.	NEG
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.	NEG
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.	NEG
Filmiing was less expansive.	NEG
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.	NEG
Generally; it just lacked imagination.	NEG
Not recommended.	NEG
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?	NEG
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.	NEG
Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.	NEG
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!	NEG
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!	NEG
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!	NEG
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.	POS
But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.	POS
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.	POS
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).	POS
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.	POS
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.	POS
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.	NEG
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.	NEG
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.	POS
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.	NEG
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.	NEG
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?	NEG
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.	NEG
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.	NEG
The story line is just awful!	NEG
It's just painful!	NEG
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!	NEG
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.	NEG
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.	NEG
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.	POS
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.	POS
Go watch it!	POS
Omit watching this.	NEG
VERY funny!	POS
My rating: just 3 out of 10.	NEG
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.	POS
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.	POS
Don't miss it.	POS
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.	POS
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).	POS
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.	POS
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.	POS
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.	NEG
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.	NEG
Avoid at all costs.	NEG
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!	POS
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!	POS
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!	POS
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.	POS
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.	POS
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!	POS
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.	NEG
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.	NEG
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.	POS
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.	POS
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.	POS
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!	POS
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !	POS
But it is entertaining, nonetheless.	POS
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.	POS
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.	POS
The cast is always entertaining as usual.	POS
Overall, a delight!	POS
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.	NEG
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.	NEG
The least said about the acting the better.	NEG
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.	POS
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.	POS
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.	POS
The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.	POS
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10	POS
Excellent performance.	POS
There still are good actors around!	POS
Also great directing and photography.	POS
Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.	POS
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.	POS
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.	POS
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.	POS
This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.	POS
Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.	POS
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.	POS
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.	POS
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.	NEG
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.	NEG
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.	POS
It is not good.	NEG
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.	NEG
Then the film just dropped the ball.	NEG
This is a stunning movie.	POS
Raw and sublimely moving.	POS
It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.	POS
All of the main players are mesmerising.	POS
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.	POS
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.	POS
He's a national treasure.	POS
GO AND SEE IT!	POS
This is an excellent film.	POS
The aerial scenes were well-done.	POS
It was also the right balance of war and love.	POS
The film gives meaning to the phrase, "Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.	POS
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.	POS
A good film by a great director!	POS
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.	POS
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.	NEG
This is just a great movie.	POS
10 out of 10 stars.	POS
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.	NEG
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.	NEG
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.	POS
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.	POS
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.	POS
I advise you to look out for it.	POS
You wont regret it!	POS
Highly recommended A+	POS
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.	NEG
It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.	NEG
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.	NEG
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.	NEG
It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.	NEG
How awful she is!	NEG
But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.	NEG
The results, well, are a shame.	NEG
DELETE this film from your mind!	NEG
One of the worst shows of all time.	NEG
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.	NEG
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???	NEG
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.	NEG
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.	NEG
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.	NEG
Lame would be the best way to describe it.	NEG
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.	POS
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.	POS
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.	POS
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.	NEG
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.	NEG
You can find better movies at youtube.	NEG
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.	NEG
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.	NEG
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.	NEG
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.	NEG
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.	NEG
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.	NEG
Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.	NEG
Avoid, avoid, avoid!	NEG
It will drive you barking mad!	NEG
The transfers are very good.	POS
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.	POS
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!	POS
) some great music, and terrific scenery.	POS
It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!	POS
) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!	POS
The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.	POS
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!	POS
Nothing new there.	NEG
That was done in the second movie.	NEG
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.	NEG
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.	NEG
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?	NEG
I just saw this film and I recommend it.	POS
It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.	POS
A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.	POS
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.	POS
Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.	POS
Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.	POS
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.	POS
Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).	POS
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.	POS
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.	POS
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.	NEG
But I thought his acting was skilled.	POS
Meredith M was better than all right.	POS
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.	POS
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.	POS
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.	POS
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.	POS
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.	POS
A standout scene.	POS
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.	NEG
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.	POS
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.	POS
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.	POS
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.	POS
This movie is also revealing.	POS
Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.	POS
And it was boring.	NEG
I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.	NEG
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.	POS
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.	POS
An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.	POS
All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.	POS
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.	POS
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.	POS
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.	POS
You won't forget this movie!	POS
Why was this film made?	NEG
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.	NEG
The result is a film that just don't look right.	NEG
None of them are engaging or exciting.	NEG
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.	NEG
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.	NEG
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.	POS
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.	POS
This movie is so awesome!	POS
I loved it, it was really scary.	POS
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.	POS
If you want a real scare rent this one!	POS
10/10	POS
This is an extraordinary film.	POS
As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.	POS
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.	POS
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.	POS
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.	POS
Predictable, but not a bad watch.	POS
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.	POS
She carries the movie well.	POS
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.	POS
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.	POS
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.	NEG
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.	NEG
Avoid at ALL costs!	NEG
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.	NEG
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.	NEG
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.	NEG
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.	NEG
The worst one of the series.	NEG
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.	POS
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.	POS
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.	POS
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.	POS
This film offers many delights and surprises.	POS
When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.	POS
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.	POS
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.	POS
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.	POS
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.	POS
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.	POS
The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.	POS
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.	POS
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.	POS
Conclusion - I loved it.	POS
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.	POS
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.	POS
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.	POS
It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.	POS
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.	POS
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!	POS
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.	POS
Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).	POS
See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.	POS
See both films if you can.	POS
It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella "The Dead.	POS
Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.	POS
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.	NEG
It's very slow.	NEG
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.	NEG
) Don't waste your time.	NEG
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.	NEG
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.	NEG
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.	NEG
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.	NEG
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.	POS
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.	POS
" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.	POS
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.	POS
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.	POS
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?	NEG
Lots of holes in the script.	NEG
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.	NEG
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.	NEG
The dialogue is atrocious.	NEG
The acting is beyond abysmal.	NEG
Everything stinks.	NEG
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.	NEG
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.	NEG
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.	NEG
In short, don't bother with this movie.	NEG
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.	POS
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.	POS
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!	POS
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.	POS
A film not easily forgotten.	POS
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.	POS
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.	POS
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.	POS
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!	POS
Great movie!	POS
Also the story and acting were weak.	NEG
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.	NEG
Either way, it sucks.	NEG
The script is horrendously stupid.	NEG
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.	NEG
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.	NEG
What the hell kind of crap is that?!	NEG
Then, there's the plot holes.	NEG
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!	NEG
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.	POS
She's poised and amazing.	POS
Dee Snider just plain sucks.	NEG
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?	NEG
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.	NEG
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.	NEG
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.	NEG
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.	NEG
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.	NEG
Avoid at any and all costs.	NEG
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.	NEG
Avoid this film at all costs.	NEG
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.	NEG
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.	NEG
Now this is a movie I really dislike.	NEG
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.	NEG
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.	NEG
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.	NEG
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.	NEG
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.	NEG
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.	POS
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.	POS
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.	POS
Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.	NEG
This one just fails to create any real suspense.	NEG
As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.	NEG
There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).	POS
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.	NEG
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.	NEG
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.	NEG
Hated it.	NEG
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.	NEG
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!	NEG
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.	NEG
This is not movie-making.	NEG
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.	NEG
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!	NEG
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.	POS
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.	POS
Excellent short film.	POS
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.	POS
I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.	NEG
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.	NEG

Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!	POS
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.	POS
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.	POS
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.	POS
I rate this movie 9/10.	POS
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.	POS
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.	POS
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".	POS
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.	POS
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.	POS
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.	POS
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.	POS
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.	POS
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.	POS
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.	POS
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.	POS
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.	POS
Go rent it.	POS
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.	POS
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.	POS
Brilliance indeed.	POS
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.	POS
Think of the film being like a dream.	POS
Simply beautiful.	POS
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.	POS
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.	POS
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.	POS
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.	NEG
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.	NEG
The movie seemed a little slow at first.	NEG
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.	POS

The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.	POS
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.	POS
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.	POS
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.	POS
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.	POS
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.	POS
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.	POS
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.	POS
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!	NEG
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.	NEG
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.	NEG
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.	POS
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.	POS
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.	NEG
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.	POS
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.	POS

She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!	POS
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.	POS
;) Recommend with confidence!	POS
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.	POS
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).	POS
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.	POS
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.	POS
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.	POS
Lange had become a great actress.	POS
It looked like a wonderful story.	POS
